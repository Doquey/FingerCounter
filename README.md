# FingerCounter



# Project introdution
This project was inspired on the  very similar one showed in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01sAkU_NvOY&list=PLbgk7_D8UNxdSFnrSKWtpz6e_pernYpSI&index=6.

The diference is that here we are counting from 0 to 10 and we use a slightly diferent approach to check if our fingers are closed or not and I alter a little bit the handtrackingmodule used in  thevideo. Feel free to clone this repository and have fun with it.
